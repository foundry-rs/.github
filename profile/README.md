Welcome to the Foundry organization.

Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.

You can install Foundry on any platform in seconds via:

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Then, in a new terminal run: `foundryup`.

That's it! If everything goes well, you will now have four binaries at your disposal: forge, cast, anvil, and chisel.

See the [Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) for more.

Foundry development is spearheaded by [Paradigm](https://github.com/paradigmxyz) and the Rust Ethereum open-source community.
